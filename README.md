# CNNs-for-AD-Detection

This project uses a pretrained computer vision model to look at the end-to-end process of creating a deep learning application which can classify MR images with Alzheimer's disease. The architecture we are using is the pretrained ResNet-18 (Residual Network with 18 layers).
